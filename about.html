  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi! My name is Ryan Russo and I'm a rising 4th year in the University of Virginia's School of Engineering and Applied Science.
    I will be graduating in May 2026 with a major in Computer Science and minors in Data Science and Politics, and I am 
    looking for opportunities in Data Science and Tech Consulting.
